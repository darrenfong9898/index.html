                        <p>1. <b>Humble beginnings & struggle:</b><br><br>I didn’t start as a top student. My early academic journey was filled with setbacks, and I often questioned if I could ever catch up. But those struggles became the foundation of my resilience.</p>
                        <p>2. <b>Turning point: discipline & consistency</b><br><br>Through discipline, self-study, and staying one semester ahead, I rebuilt my foundation. Over time, I not only improved I consistently achieved straight A’s, became the top student of my diploma cohort, and led every group project I was part of.</p>
                        <p>3. <b>First professional breakthrough:</b><br><br>At ACP Group, my first internship, I turned classroom knowledge into real-world results. I revamped receivables systems with automation, built client websites, optimized marketing campaigns, and contributed to record-breaking sales growth. I earned recognition directly from the Managing Director, who noted that my work would leave a lasting mark.</p>
                        <p>4. <b>National Service & “Spartan training”:</b><br><br>Now in National Service, I see these two years as mental Spartan training. Beyond my finance clerk role, I treat each day as discipline training while continuing to pursue professional certifications in digital marketing, data analytics, and software development. Stress isn’t just pressure it’s resistance training, and every challenge sharpens me further.</p>
                        <p>5. <b>My vision:</b><br><br>I am building myself into a rare hybrid professional combining business acumen, technical development, data analytics, and leadership. My long-term vision is to become a business & tech leader who can bridge strategy with execution, and build systems that drive growth.</p>
